# Features of Go

- Statically typed
- Fast run time
- Supports concurrency through goroutines and channels
- Does not support classes, objects and inheritance

# Go quickstart
- Type `go mod init tutorial` to initialize the go.mod file
- Run the code `go run .\main.go`

# Syntax
### A Go file consist of the following parts:

  - Packages declaration
  - Import packages
  - Functions
  - Statements and expressions

### Variables
- Datatype
  - `int` stores integers
  - `string` stores text
  - `bool` stores values with two states: true or false
  - `float32` stores floating point numbers, with decimals

- Declare a variable
  - `var name = "Hiệp"` (global)
  - `name := "Hiệp"` (function)
  - With the above two methods, the compiler can automatically infer the datatype for the variable
